# n'kisi

N'kisi (in-key-see) is a microblogging platform using React and Flux (uni-directional data flow) with Skeleton in lieu of Bootstrap for CSS, and a custom stores implementation.  

The name comes from an African grey parrot, named N'kisi, that is thought to exhibit advanced English talking skills and other abilities.  N'kisi has a vocabulary of 950 words and can 'communicate' (as opposed to repeat).

Not ready for public consumption.
